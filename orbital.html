                        <ul>
                            <li>College students</li>
                            <li>Ages 18-25</li>
                            <li>Those who find traditional productivity tools too rigid or uninspiring and struggle with focus, motivation, or procrastination in high-distraction environments</li>
                            <li>Users who value a more human-centered, gamified approach to time management that promotes balance, motivation, and sustained attention</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p><strong>Gen Z's are stressed and struggle with keeping track of their daily tasks due to existing services that do not allow them to organize their tasks in a comprehensible manner and lacking features to allow students to stay motivated.</strong></p>
                        <h3>User Research</h3>
                        <p><strong>User Interview Key Insights</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During the development of <em>Orbital</em>, we conducted interviews with twelve users from various backgrounds including UI/UX design, human development, informatics, English, and animal science to better understand their time management habits, preferred task tools, and pain points with existing productivity systems.</li>
                            <li>Motivation was tied to visualization and progress tracking, whether through calendar color-coding, disappearing completed tasks, or physical tools like planners and whiteboards. Users expressed frustration when apps lacked satisfying feedback or customizable prioritization.</li>
                            <li>There was a divide between preference for customization and need for simplicity: users wanted flexible tools, but excessive complexity or rigid design discouraged consistent use. They valued progressive disclosure, revealing complexity only when needed.</li>
                            <li>The top desire was <strong>an intuitive, aesthetically pleasant, and centralized system</strong> that merges reminders with flexible task notes, provides visual structure (like color or subtask organization), and supports self-regulation without overwhelming notifications.</li>
                            <li>Opportunity: <em>Orbital</em> can stand out by balancing simplicity with optional depth, helping users structure their time without cognitive overload, especially during high-pressure periods like exams, work deadlines, or creative sprints.</li>

                                <h4>Exploring Features, Flow, and Data Use</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We mapped out key flows for users to track tasks, set Pomodoro timers, and earn in-app rewards as motivational feedback. Sketches focused on supporting flexibility for quick task creation, while also offering detailed settings like priority, categories, repetition, and collaborators.</li>
                                    <li>The design emphasizes modularity and progressive disclosure with basic functions (e.g., adding a quick task or viewing today's schedule) are surfaced first, while deeper customization (e.g., editing due dates, collaborating, or filtering tasks) is nested within intuitive icon-based menus.</li>
                                    <li>A coin-based rewards system was prototyped to gamify productivity. We introduced visual "reward boxes" and collectible items as incentives to encourage habit-forming behaviors over time.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Interface Drafting and Navigation</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We developed multiple layout variations to explore how users might interact with their task lists, Pomodoro session tracking, and a calendar-based overview. The week-view calendar with task blocks allows for clear visual prioritization and breakdown.</li>
                                    <li>Navigation flows were unified across all designs with a persistent bottom nav bar for Home, Pomodoro, Add Task, Rewards, and Profile. This ensures fast access to core functions while minimizing decision fatigue.</li>
                                    <li>Filtering tools, collaborator inputs, and repeat task settings were integrated in the task creation flow to reflect real user needs gathered from interviews, particularly the demand for clear organization and just-in-time motivation without overwhelming complexity.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>As <em>Orbital</em> aims to make productivity feel <strong>playful</strong>, <strong>personal</strong>, and <strong>rewarding</strong>, our visual design language was crafted to inspire joy, focus, and a sense of light-hearted momentum. Whether a user is cramming for finals or simply organizing their week, <em>Orbital</em> wants to feel like a friendly companion rather than another rigid to-do list.</p>

The pairing supports <em>Orbital</em>'s mission: making productivity less overwhelming and more human.</li>

                        <li>Users appreciated <em>Orbital</em>'s <strong>ease of use</strong>, noting that core navigation felt natural and not overwhelming.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>collection and blind box reward system</strong> was particularly well-received, with testers describing it as "fun" and "motivating," reinforcing our hypothesis that gamification could improve user engagement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Several testers felt the <strong>blind box mechanic was confusing</strong>, so they weren't sure how to earn or use rewards effectively.</li>
                        <li>Users wanted the ability to <strong>check off tasks as completed</strong>, and expressed frustration when they couldn't clearly track their progress.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>home screen felt visually cluttered</strong>, making it harder to quickly grasp task priorities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Changes Based on Feedback</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We added a <strong>short onboarding tutorial</strong> to walk users through the reward system and interface on first launch.</li>
                        <li>We introduced <strong>checkboxes</strong> next to each task for satisfying visual completion and better user control.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>blind box system</strong> is now <strong>integrated with the points system</strong>, making it clear how users earn rewards and when they can redeem them—tying productivity directly to progress.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="reflection-caption">
                    <p>After completing the final version of <em>Orbital</em>, we took a moment to reflect on both the successes of our design process and the areas that still hold room for growth. From early ideation to polished handoff, the journey reaffirmed our focus on building a product that blends productivity with warmth and play.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What Went Well</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We received encouraging feedback, including quotes like <em>"What a cute app!"</em> from potential users, validating our approach to visual design and emotional tone.</li>
                        <li>Our team maintained a clear understanding of the <strong>problem space and target audience</strong>, ensuring that user needs shaped every stage of development.</li>
                        <li>The transition from <strong>sketches and mid-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity designs</strong> was smooth and aligned well with our initial vision.</li>
                        <li>Usability testing results were <strong>mainly positive</strong>, especially in response to features like gamified rewards and clean navigation.</li>
                        <li>Our efforts in <strong>branding</strong> created a memorable and consistent personality for the app that resonated with testers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>What Could Be Improved</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some users noted that the <strong>art style lacked consistency</strong>, and illustrations could be further polished to enhance overall visual cohesion.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>color scheme</strong> did not fully support the calming, motivational mood we aimed to create—this is something we'd refine in future iterations.</li>
                        <li>From a UI standpoint, certain <strong>font and layout choices</strong> affected readability and flow across the app, especially on longer task views.</li>
                        <li>While the cartoon mascot helped create an inviting tone, the <strong>style may skew a bit young</strong>, and could be adjusted to better appeal to a broader millennial user base.</li>
